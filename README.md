# Linear-Regression-Summative

# Task 1
# Univariate Linear Regression Model
* This model is designed to predict sales based on the amount spent on TV advertising. The model uses TV advertising expenditure as the single feature to predict sales, the target variable. The model's performance is evaluated on the testing set to assess its predictive accuracy and is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn.

# Task 2
# Multivariate Linear Regression Model
* This model is designed to predict medical insurance costs based on the age of the individual, a measure of body fat based on height and weight(BMI), The number of children covered under the insurance plan, and whether the individual is a smoker or not.
* FastApi was created for this model to predict medical insurance costs and the backend is hosted on Render, making the model accessible via API endpoints.
